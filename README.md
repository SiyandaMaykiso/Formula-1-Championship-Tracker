# Formula-1-Championship-Tracker
I have coded a Formula 1 Championship Tracker that uses HTML, CSS, and AngularJS code for this frontend application. It tracks the Formula 1 championship using a Formula 1 API. This application is designed to display the current standings for the Formula 1 Championship.

##Purpose

This application is ideal for those who are busy and on the go. The championship tracker updates after each race and allows the user to stay updated on the championship

## Requirements
To run the application, you will need:

A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

##Usage

Once the application is running, you can view the current championship standings in the table displayed on the page. The table includes columns for the driver's position, name, team, nationality, points, and wins.

You can also filter the results by team by selecting a team from the dropdown menu
